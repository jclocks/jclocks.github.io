  <h1>Hi!</h1>
  <h3>Johnny Tirado | jclocks @ github</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>This is a simple static page to basically say hello. I might blog a bit on this. This is also meant to be a landing page to my various repos here.</p>
  <p>My name is Johnny and I back up and revive servers for a living, and am a computer technician by career, though I might want to get into the engineering side of things soon. On the side I like to learn about all things Linux, and that involves learning programming languages and development.</p>
  <p>This site may or may not get updated, I'm a bit fickle with that kind of stuff.</p>
